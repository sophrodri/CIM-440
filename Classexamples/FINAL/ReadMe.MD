# photosoph - CIM FINAL

I'm making this program as my Final project because I was inspired by many celebrities using photo booth pop ups as their party favors for their get togethers; so why not make my own?

My inputs include the user clicking the filter and camera buttons themselves.
(All filters were made on Photoshop by me, Sophia Rodriguez -- hence the title "PhotoSoph")

The outputs are the filters being applied with the mouse press of the filter button and the automatic Canvas save of the picture taken.

The target audience would be millenials, Gen X,Y,and Z that love taking photos and making memories.

My project would be displayed at private events such as parties and special occasions where the host would want a photobooth application.
